# N     Instruction Number:
#       is the step number and has no effect for the input
# HRM   Horizontal Relative Movement:
#       Horizontal movement in microsteps
# VRM   Vertical Relativ Movement:
#       Vertical movement in microsteps
# HS    Horizontal Speed:
#       Horizontal movement speed in microsteps/s
# VS    Vertical speed:
#       Vertical movement speed in microsteps/s
# S     Shot Frequency:
#       Shot frequency: - positive = shooting at a given frequency,
#                       - zero     = single shot,
#                       - negative = shooting after movement at a given frequency
# SC    Number of Shots:
#       Shot count, only relevant if a negative shot frequency is selected. Used to determine the time to hold during
#       the shooting of the laser. To do a move without shooting, select a negative frequency and set this value to 0.
# AT    Attenuator Positions:
#       Absolute attenuator position
# AP    Aperture Pos:
#       Absolute aperture position (not implemented yet)
