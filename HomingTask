To find a home position:
 1. Can we drive into end switches, how is the repetability of this? -> try 500 times + plot the variability.
 2. If ok, job finished.
 3. If not: Build a software PID regulator to find a home position with the needed repeatability.

 What is the needed repeatability: Should be such that the regions where we shoot between the field cage rings is hit reliably.
